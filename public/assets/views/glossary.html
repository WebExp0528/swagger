			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Remediation or Action</strong> - Is a process meant to reduce risk or prevent recurrence of incidents. A Remediation or Action can be associated with an Incident or Finding in the AasriControl System.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Compliance - SOX  </strong> - Sarbanes Oxley Manage SOX templates and Test Plans and Test Results</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)- Manage BASEL, DFAST Templates and Assessments and Test Plans and Reports.</strong>

			</p><p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Control</strong> - Process or procedure within an organization to adhere to industry standards and policies.
				For example COBIT, NIST, SOX</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Test Plan</strong> - List of Testplans with Controls being tested</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Test Result</strong> - List of Test Results for the Test Plans</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong> Risk Assessment System</strong> - Four dimensions should be utilized in the Risk Assessment System in reviewing Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Liquidity Risk, Price Risk, Transaction Risk, and Compliance Risk.
				They are as follows: Quantity of Risk, Quality of Risk Management, Aggregate Risk and Direction of Risk.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Quantity of Risk</strong> - Quantity of Risk is the level or volume of risk that the Bank faces and is characterized as low, moderate, or high.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Quality of Risk Management</strong> - The Quality of Risk Management is how well risks are identified, measured, controlled, and monitored and is characterized as strong, satisfactory, or weak.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Aggregate Risk </strong> - Aggregate Risk is defined as a summary judgment about the level of supervisory concern.  It incorporates judgments about the quantity of risk and the quality of risk management.  The Audit Department should weigh the relative importance of each and should characterize such risk as low, moderate, or high.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Direction of Risk</strong> - Direction of risk is the probable change in the aggregate level of risk over the next twelve months and is characterized as decreasing, stable, or increasing.
				The direction of risk will influence the audit review strategy, including the extent that expanded procedures might be used.  If the risk is decreasing, the Auditor
				expects aggregate risk to decline over the next twelve months.  If the risk is stable, the Auditor expects aggregate risk to remain unchanged.  If the risk is increasing,
				the Auditor expects aggregate risk to be higher in twelve months,</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Assessment </strong>- One-time or recurring Monitoring activity or Data collection leading to a standard process for Audit or Risk Management utilizing a defined template by the organization or an industry standard. </p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Assessment Submission</strong> - Submitting an Assessment for review or completion.</p>
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>Template Library</strong> - Set of Blank Templates which can be used for Assessments. Some of them are industry standard and are downloaded from Federal Regulatory Agencies and OCC.
				Note: An Assessment is like an Audit in that it is measuring something. A Completed Template is like a list Topics. In that the Completed Template will indicate how well the items being measured have performed. The implication is that Assessments might have actions associated to track remediation of low assessment performance.
				This implies that Templates can be parsed to create findings. This works well then will actions for remediating findings and can operate like an Audit from that perspective. Templates rows can be tied to controls with source and Control ID as unique identifier. Template row will have two additional fields: 1.) Results which will match a Topic, and 2.) Finding description. These will then be used to generate findings. </p>
			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>RCSA </strong> - Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA) - a framework that is used by firms to analyze its operational risk profile.</p>

			<p style="font-size:13px; margin-bottom:10px;"><strong>CyberSecurity Assessment</strong> -Information Technology, Asset Awareness, Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried , NIST-FW, ID.AM-1, Failed, Incomplete Inventory, Y, Asset inventory is incomplete - desktops missingLife-Cycle Operations and Management Processes, Requirements and System Conceptualization, Business operations and systems design requirements are considered together in light of security requirements built from standard repeatable processes across the enterprise.,  Passed, Artifacts have been verified.</p>
